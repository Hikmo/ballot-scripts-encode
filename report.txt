5-Delegate Vote
For doing this first we will have to give vote rights to another account from chairman 
which will then delegate the voting rights
For giving rights:
Transaction hash:  0x75099420237ab96c23ddab8424b5dec147715243d5e4de990ab8f2c7caec6a5c
Voting right is given to:  0xF7c4A02B846474e56aA3222c161a1DB18FEA2e04
Secondly because of the following assertion require(delegate_.weight >= 1); we should give voting
rights to the address we will delegate the vote to as well.
For giving rights:
Transaction hash:  0xd9c28d0f931779c31c314c6b241424801df5798c5ab4b7e928d664d37cdf569b

Now we can delegate from 0xF7c4A02B846474e56aA3222c161a1DB18FEA2e04 
to 0xAeC1d37Ec896b6B3d8367A2974Ba4549fac5c58E
